# This is my new personal Portfolio
## After studying a lot about JS and Its fundmentals by doing many personal projects it was the time for me to create a new portfolio that comply with DRY method and below I will breakdown this site:-
## I could use React for this project but since I was aiming in doing static light-weight site without the need of many functions that React provides. I made this site using components (class based programming) just like React.

- class based programming using pure JS (aka Vanilla JS).
- used SCSS to style the site.
- projects thumbnails was made in photoshop by me.
